# Masterplan: Australian Travel Blog & Directory

## 1. App Overview and Objectives

This project aims to create a comprehensive travel blogging website for Australia, similar in design and user experience to visitgreatoceanroad.org.au, but covering destinations and experiences across the entire country. The primary objective is to provide valuable and engaging content for travelers planning trips to Australia, while also offering a detailed directory of hotels, restaurants, experiences, and tourist places. The website will be SEO-optimized to attract organic traffic and establish itself as a go-to resource for Australian travel information.

## 2. Target Audience

The target audience for this website includes:

* Domestic and international tourists planning trips to Australia.
* Individuals and families looking for travel inspiration, destination guides, and practical travel tips.
* Users interested in discovering unique experiences, finding accommodation, and dining options across Australia.

## 3. Core Features and Functionality

* **Blog Section:**
    * Mix of content including destination guides, travel tips, and personal stories.
    * Categorization and tagging of blog posts (following the structure of visitgreatoceanroad.org.au, expanded for all of Australia).

## 4. High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

* **Frontend and Backend:** Next.js (JavaScript framework) - Chosen for its full-stack capabilities with JavaScript, excellent SEO features (server-side rendering), scalability, and performance.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational Database) - Recommended for its reliability, scalability, and suitability for structured data like blog posts and directory listings.
* **Mapping Service:** Google Maps - For displaying locations and embedding interactive maps.
* **Analytics Platform:** Google Analytics - For tracking website traffic and user behavior.
* **Authentication:** Token-based authentication (JWT) - For a scalable and secure way to handle backend access and potential future user accounts.

* Intuitive and clear navigation.
* Mobile-first approach to ensure responsiveness.
* Engaging presentation of blog content with clear hierarchy.

## 7. Security Considerations

* Implement token-based authentication (JWT) securely.
* Use HTTPS for all website traffic.
* Protect against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

* Secure password storage (hashing and salting) if user accounts are implemented in the future.
