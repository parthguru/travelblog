# technology.md: High-Level Technology Setup

This document provides a high-level overview of the steps involved in setting up the recommended technology stack for the Australian Travel Blog & Directory. Specific commands and configurations may vary depending on your operating system and development environment.

## 1. Install Prerequisites

* **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** Next.js is built on Node.js. You'll need to have Node.js and its package manager (npm is included with Node.js, or you can use yarn) installed on your development machine.
    * **Steps:** Go to the official Node.js website (nodejs.org) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions. Alternatively, you can use a package manager like nvm (Node Version Manager).
    * To verify installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run:
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        # or
        yarn --version
        ```

## 2. Set up Next.js Project

* **Create a new Next.js project:** Use the `create-next-app` command.
    * **Steps:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then run:
        ```bash
        npx create-next-app@latest your-project-name
        # or with yarn
        yarn create next-app your-project-name
        ```
    * Follow the prompts to configure your project (e.g., using TypeScript, ESLint).
    * Navigate into your project directory: `cd your-project-name`

## 3. Install PostgreSQL

* **Install PostgreSQL server:** You'll need to install a PostgreSQL server on your development machine or a remote server.
    * **Steps:** The installation process varies depending on your operating system. You can find detailed instructions on the official PostgreSQL website (postgresql.org) or by searching for "install PostgreSQL on [your operating system]". Common methods include using package managers like `apt` (for Debian/Ubuntu), `brew` (for macOS), or downloading an installer for Windows.

## 4. Set up Database

* **Create a database and user:** Once PostgreSQL is installed, you'll need to create a database for your project and a user with the necessary permissions to access it.
    * **Steps:** You can use a PostgreSQL client tool (like `psql` in the terminal or pgAdmin) to connect to the server and execute SQL commands to create the database and user.

## 5. Install PostgreSQL Driver for Node.js

* **Install the `pg` package:** This is a popular Node.js driver for connecting to PostgreSQL.
    * **Steps:** In your Next.js project directory, run:
        ```bash
        npm install pg
        # or with yarn
        yarn add pg
        ```

## 6. Configure Environment Variables

* **Set up database connection details:** You'll need to store your PostgreSQL connection information (host, port, database name, username, password) as environment variables that your Next.js application can access.
    * **Steps:** Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your Next.js project and add your database connection details:
        ```
        DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_user:your_password@your_host:your_port/your_database
        ```
        Replace the placeholders with your actual database credentials.

## 7. Project Structure (Conceptual)

A typical Next.js project structure might look something like this:
Travelblog/
├── pages/         # Frontend routes and components
│   ├── api/       # Backend API routes
│   └── ...
├── public/        # Static assets (images, etc.)
├── styles/        # CSS styles
├── components/    # Reusable UI components
├── lib/           # Utility functions, database connections
└── .env.local     # Environment variables
└── package.json
└── ...
## 8. Backend Development (Next.js API Routes)

* You'll use Next.js API routes (within the `pages/api` directory) to create the backend logic for fetching and managing data from your PostgreSQL database.

## 9. Frontend Development (React Components)

* You'll build your website's user interface using React components within the `pages` and `components` directories. These components will fetch data from your backend API routes and display it to the user.

## 10. Deployment

* Once your application is developed, you'll need to deploy it to a hosting provider. Popular choices for Next.js applications include Vercel and Netlify, which offer easy deployment and automatic updates. You'll also need to ensure your PostgreSQL database is accessible in your production environment.
